##  About Me

I'm a passionate infrastructure engineer specializing in **bare metal servers**, **Kubernetes orchestration**, and **cloud-native architectures**. With deep expertise in **deep learning** and **AI**, I bridge the gap between infrastructure and machine learning workloads. I hold professional certifications in **Microsoft Azure (AZ-104)** and **Google Cloud Platform (Professional Cloud Architect)**, enabling me to design and implement robust, scalable solutions across multiple cloud providers.

###  What I Do

-  **Bare Metal Server Management**: Expert in provisioning, configuring, and optimizing physical infrastructure for high-performance workloads
-  **Kubernetes**: Building and managing containerized applications at scale with K8s
-  **AI/ML Infrastructure**: Designing infrastructure for deep learning models and AI workloads
-  **Multi-Cloud Architect**: Certified in Azure and GCP, designing cloud-native solutions
